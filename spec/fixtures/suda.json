  "bio" : "Goichi Suda, born January 2, 1968), also known as Suda51, is the CEO of Grasshopper Manufacture and a former designer at Human Entertainment. The '51' in his nickname, Suda51, is a pun on his given name. In Japanese, 'Go' means 5 and 'ichi' means 1. His works include Moonlight Syndrome, The Silver Case, Flower, Sun and Rain, Michigan, killer7, the No More Heroes series, Shadows of the Damned and most recently, Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer is Dead. He has been called an 'auteur' video game director. Suda and his studio also frequently collaborate with other developers, including creating the story sequences for the Wii title Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, Suda's involvement in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (his nickname 'Suda51' appears in the credits for the game's 'Subspace Emissary' mode), and a radio drama prequel to Snatcher with Hideo Kojima titled Sdatcher."
